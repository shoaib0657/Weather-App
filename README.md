# Weather-App

I developed a simple Weather App using Node.js, Express, and OpenWeatherMap API. This application fetches real-time weather data for any location worldwide. Users can easily search for a location and view current weather conditions. 

### Key Technologies Used:
- Node.js: Backend JavaScript runtime
- Express: Web application framework for Node.js
- OpenWeatherMap API: Integration for weather data retrieval
- Git: Version control and collaboration

### Require environment variables
- API_KEY=yourapikey
